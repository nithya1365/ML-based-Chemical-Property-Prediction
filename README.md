# ML-based-Chemical-Property-Prediction
This project predicts that value of logS based on inputs from user which are based on molecular properties like molecular logP, molecular weight, rotatable bonds and aromatic proportions. 

open the ipynb file in colab and run the code blocks. run the code block under the label "main program" for taking input from user.
